	"description": "Zenith ~\r\n\r\nShe used to be human before but after her death (at a young age), she reincarnated into a star. But in the process she lost most of her memories and capabilities of feeling many emotions or even her empathy. She's minimal now and slowly learns to understand new emotions.\r\n\r\nShe is troubled, since she got stuck with a little happy memory that she still keeps of her best friend and also romantic interest and she wishes to experience them again.\r\n\r\nAbout her personality, well, she is what you could consider a kuudere since most of the time she barely shows disgust, true happiness or strong emotions. Most of the emotions she shows are her attempt of copying them to look more friendly\/alive but it is also her trying to get her human side back.\r\n\r\nIn the other hand, her star nature is more prominent and she can be violent with others of her kind. Her empathy is minimal, so she wouldn't doubt before killing another star if it meant that she can survive. She could be benevolent with someone but she doesn't feel guilt from hurting\/killing.\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\nI thought came to my mind as I was making this song, what if I made a drop that was just pure saw waves, I always loved how the pure saw sounds and finally having a tune that demonstrates that it make's me really excited\r\n\r\nDownload: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbGxKSHcySTRLMlVfRHBURnZicVU5QzAxS3BJUXxBQ3Jtc0ttUEdyNnFlOExSa0ZKZzkxM19SYjI5bVVrVFBwVS1BVy1CeW9jdGtVS0hFcGNrQlpxaW04NktQS2hUcTgtSFppX2I4X2dVcHJvVE5ZMm5jOEc2T2ZjTFFNdjdieHhnVWxqbUh4NVpDUDA0WEhDeUc3WQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fbeta.geoxor.moe%2Fdownloads%2Fsongs&v=eHL0r0r69cE\r\nStream on Spotify: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXo2QVpaZmI3c05aZFlUbGhnLUR1TmIwclR1UXxBQ3Jtc0tsMFZ0NXZKWUpFUTVyUDRTRGZSTVhKaHRzX0ZxNHZjV0VXLVhwS2l1X0R6THdYcUdHc2hnalRmVUY3V2U3RXY2WkdGc2laTzRpSE5RdW1UN054WS1rZGZqQ1dSeGVLbmRzd2pFMW9lN2NsNlp1UWVoaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Ftrack%2F5Oyh9x69QS9H4gkk8r4Tns&v=eHL0r0r69cE\r\n\r\nArtwork by: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHdMNllIMTFRZmZJTG9vNmdjWFNrb2VFOFZ0Z3xBQ3Jtc0ttYVVwTU1sdlhobEZ0ckJOeVlRcUxvcnhNRHM0LXlKNlhyTzlkb1VoaTNDWlZsZTlybWUwUDFPSnlYOFhBV3VSaXEyNkhrS09HSktZU3lybkV3WFhsVGl5LUhfWjgtNUgweHFselZ2eDhYRy1lOXJldw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmekaiime%2F&v=eHL0r0r69cE\r\n\r\n0:00 - Intro\r\n0:30 - Climax\r\n1:00 - Breakdown\r\n1:30 - Buildup\r\n1:45 - Drop A\r\n2:15 - Climax\r\n2:30 - Orchestral Breakdown\r\n3:00 - Trance Buildup\r\n3:45 - Drop B\r\n4:15 - Drop C\r\n4:45 - Outro\r\n\r\n#Geoxor #Zenith #Mekaiime",
