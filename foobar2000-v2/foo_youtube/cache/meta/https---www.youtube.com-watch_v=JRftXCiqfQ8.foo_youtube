	"description": "Just in time for Spring comes Bassnectar's 'Timestretch EP ', a seven-track roller coaster ride through the amusement park of amorphous bass music.\r\n\r\nThe face-melting banger 'Bass Head laughs in the face of genres as it pounds you with bass. Watch-out! It's like dubstep at warp speed, or more of that crazy mutant half-time jungle with hyphy 808 bass and a mega-sticky hook.\r\n\r\nAmorphous Music has teamed up with Basshead Music for the limited edition vinyl release of Bass Head, as well as the Bassnectar remix of Teleport Massive from his chart topping Cozza Frenzy album release.\r\n\r\nVisit https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEVNVVNHQ0lQRHlQNDI3RlhhRUpib0JfNG1TZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttM3A0U3YxQWNQYjhyMFIxVnBfcmFUZDN6VVNjTHQzeTBjeFhQb2IyQlpGcGNYS2VIYWRnTWxid0daOGFOLVVZbXN5TkR1eWUtdGNyRFZvSU5kaWNJMEt6Q09xQW14cWxycGlZZ1paY2d5U0lfQi13QQ&q=http%3A%2F%2FMusic.Bassnectar.net%2F&v=JRftXCiqfQ8 to purchase the digital tracks in high-quality format, as well as exclusive bundles including CD's, T-shirts, collectors items, and vinyl pre-orders.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the Bassnectar Labs channel to be the 1st to receive notice of new exclusive music and video content from Bassnectar and Amorphous Music.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/youtube.com\/bassnectarlabs",
